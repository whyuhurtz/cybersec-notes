**About Me**

I am a college student at Jakarta State Polytechnic (PNJ), which has a high passion in cyber security and back-end development. I participated in various Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions to test the extent of my cyber security skills. Iâ€™m always committed to continuing to learn and hone my hard skills in related fields so that I can become a professional penetration tester or bug hunter.
