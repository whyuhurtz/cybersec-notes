# 📖 Cybersec Notes

{% hint style="info" %}
**About Me**

I am a college student at Jakarta State Polytechnic (PNJ), which has a high passion in cyber security and back-end development. I participated in various Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions to test the extent of my cyber security skills. I’m always committed to continuing to learn and hone my hard skills in related fields so that I can become a professional penetration tester or bug hunter.

## 👋🏻 Welcome

Welcome to my blog!. My blog mostly consists of CTF write-ups, whether they're national (Indonesia) or international events. You are welcome to read, and good luck if you find something interesting. 🚩

Actually, my goal is to be a **system administrator** or **DevOps engineer** in the future, but I enjoy playing CTF in my free time. During the CTF events, I mostly handle **pwn** (binary exploitation) and **web exploitation** challenges. For Rev, I don't like it too much because there are cipher and cryptographic things and I'm not good at math. I used AI a lot to help me solving CTF challenges, thank you ChatGPT and DeepSeek. :joy:&#x20;

Yeah, that's all from me; enjoy and keep learning.🔥
