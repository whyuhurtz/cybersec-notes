# KMIPN

## Flashback

So, I've been participated in KMIPN CTF competition and alhamdulillah in 2023 (KMIPN V at PENS) I won the **2nd place** (runner up). But honestly, in 2024 (KMIPN VI at PNJ), I failed to win, but it's oke maybe this is God plan to make me more better in the future. Insya allah.
